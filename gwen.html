    <h1>Gwen Stacy</h1>
    Gwendolyn Maxine "Gwen" Stacy is a Visions Academy student who was bitten by a radioactive spider which granted her 
    superhuman abilities causing her to become the super-heroine known as Spider-Woman. <br>
    She would go on to become her city's line of defense against multiple villains including Doctor Octopus and the Vulture. <br>
    Unfortunately, after failing to save her best friend Peter Parker, her guilt for his death caused her to attempt to distance and isolate herself from others.<br>
